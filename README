Measuring angles between points in a landscape is much easier than measuring distances. When the location of three points is known the position of the observer can be determined based solely on the angles between these points as seen by the observer. This task (known as triangulation) however requires onerous calculations - these calculations are automated by this package.

In order to install this package from CRAN type 'install.packages("triangulation")' in the R-console. Upon installation the package needs to be loaded with the command 'library("triangulation")'.

The triangulation-package contains the following functions:

- determine_postion()

- determine_region()

- determine_angles()

Please refer to the help-files for examples.
